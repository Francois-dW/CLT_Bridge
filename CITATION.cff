  The CLT_Bridge project is a computational framework
  designed for the analysis and optimization of composite
  laminate and sandwich structures. Leveraging classical
  laminate theory and advanced failure criteria, the
  framework enables engineers and researchers to evaluate
  the mechanical performance of composite materials under
  various loading conditions. Key features include
  parametric studies, visualization tools, and support for
  multiple failure criteria such as Tsai-Wu, Tsai-Hill, and
  Maximum Stress. The project is modular, allowing for easy
  integration and extension, and is implemented in Python
  for accessibility and flexibility. Applications range from
  aerospace to civil engineering, where lightweight and
  high-strength materials are critical.
